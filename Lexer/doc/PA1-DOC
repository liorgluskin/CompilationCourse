Notes:

1 - On unclosed comments, after talking to Oren the TA we print an error after unclosed comments.

2 - Oren the TA said that it is legal to treat negative int like '-5' as:
MINUS 
INTEGER(5)

3 - We allow strings to have only ASCII chars between 32 and 126

4 - We allow ints to be only within the range (-2^31) up to (2^31 - 1)
